# Maze Solver Algorithm (C)

A terminal-based application that finds the exit in a given maze using the **Backtracking** algorithm.

## 🛠 Features
* **Backtracking Algorithm:** Efficiently explores paths and backtracks upon reaching dead ends.
* **Dynamic Memory Management:** Uses pointers and dynamic arrays to handle mazes of various sizes.
* **File Handling:** Loads maze layouts from external `.txt` files.

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes
* Deep understanding of recursive functions and algorithm logic.
* Managing memory safety in C to prevent leaks.
* Implementing stack-based pathfinding logic.
